<P><BR><BR>M: Good morning, Jodie. This is Brandon
calling from Steward Talent. I have
arranged an audition for a cat food
commercial for you at the Civic Center
tomorrow.</P>
<P>W: Fantastic. Um, can you tell me anything
about the product?</P>
<P>M: Check the e-mail I just sent you. It includes
the information you will need. Uh, the
audition will start at 10 A.M. Will that be
convenient for you?</P>
<P>W: Hmm . . . I’m supposed to work until 2 P.M.
I’m going to call my boss now to see if I can
take tomorrow off. I’ll let you know for sure
in about 10 minutes.</P>
